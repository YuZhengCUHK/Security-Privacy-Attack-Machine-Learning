These parts are for sharing resources.

## Part 4

If you do not know how to build a pdf file, follow the instructions [here](https://evgenii.com/blog/creating-pdf-from-latex-in-sublime-text-3/).

Each presenter need to create a tex file named ```time-name-content```.
E.g., ```19960404-yuzheng-ILikeResearch```

Set tex root ```%!TEX root = main.tex```

Add your presentation record to main.tex ```\input{filename}```

Before push the modification, please delete the trivial files generated in "4-Presentation Summary" except ```.tex, .pdf``` 

If others have comments or questions, one can use ```\todo{xx: xxx}``` (or type a new paragraph xx: xxx) to give marks. Please tell others who you are before giving comments.
